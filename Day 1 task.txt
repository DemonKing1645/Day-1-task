1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?
                                              1.HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,it blocks all the other resources behind it.
                                              2.HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
